HOW TO USE PROGRAM:
(To exit program: File - Exit)

TABS:
    Screen - Maximise - Maximises map size
             Path points mode - Enables adding/removing of points to pathfind between (Must have 2)
             Each screen will run its own set pathfinding algorithm when pathfinding is started

    Tiles - Left-click tile square = Select tileType
            Right-click tile square = Change tileType colour (Only for custom tileTypes)
            Weight = Cost = How difficult it is to move through a tile
            (Note: Black tile = -1 weight = Impassable. All other tileTypes must have positive weight)

    Output - Where program state changes are output. Also outlines code structure

MAP:
    Left-Click = Add
    Right-Click = Remove    (Can hold mouse button for quick adding/removing)    
    Middle-Click = Fill     (TileTypes only)
    
    Can only add path points if in 'Screen' tab (and mode ON)
    Can only add tileTypes if in 'Tiles' tab
    Can only edit map if tiles are all set (Green)

PATHFINDING:
    Start pathfinding at bottom right of screen
    Must RESET before you can further edit map
